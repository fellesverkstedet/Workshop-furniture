# Whiteboard table

A whiteboard table designed to enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing. Made for combining analaog whiteboard sketching with 16:9 projection from a digital projector. Mount a prejector above your table to project drawings and toolpaths from your program of choice. We use Rhino3D and our [Bark beetle](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/Bark-beetle-parametric-toolpaths) digital fabrication plugin to make and project toolpaths for our Fab Lab machines.
